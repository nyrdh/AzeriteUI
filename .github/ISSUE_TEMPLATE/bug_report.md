Note that the use of this template is NOT optional, I ask these questions for a reason. So any future reports that just delete the template and thus do not supply a proper explanation of the problem, will be deleted and ignored.

## The problem
<!--Briefly describe the issue you are experiencing BELOW, not inside this comment section. Tell us what you were trying to do and what happened instead. If there are multiple issues or bugs, create multiple reports. If you put multiple problems in a single report, that report will be prioritized below nearly all others or possibly deleted, as we can't really use it to track progress since tags such as "solved" might only apply to one of the isses.

And remember, this is _not_ a place to ask questions. For questions, go to [our Discord](https://discord.gg/MUSfWXd) server, just remember to read the rules and keep in mind nobody there are paid, we're all just gaming enthusiasts and volunteers.-->
