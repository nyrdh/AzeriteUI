This is a custom user interface suite for World of Warcraft, containing multiple full interfaces in a single addon. Coded and designed by Lars Norberg and Daniel Troconis. It works for both WoW Retail and WoW Classic, just choose the right version to download!  

To switch between interface theme, use the commands `/go azerite` and `/go legacy`. This is a per character setting.

## **Recommended addons:**  
These are some addons I feel go very well together with our user interface. They are not required, but I recommend them as they further enhance the look and functionality in a non-intrusive manner.

## **Frequently Asked Questions:**  
### **It's so big, how can I scale it down?**  
* You can't. It's meant to be this big! We're a couple of lazy, laid back gamers, and prefer gaming in a fair distance from our screens, keeping things relaxed and simplified. Big health bars, easy to see big buttons, nothing there we don't absolutely need. We treat this as a console game, and this UI is built around that philosophy. The sizes should thus be relatively the same on all screens, relative to the height of the screen. 

### **How can I move things?**  
* You can't. This is as much UX as UI, meaning the interface is designed around a concept, this isn't meant to be a pretty skin over your current interface, it's instead a full user experience system where how you interact with the game is affected. 

### **How can I get more action buttons, and where is the stance bar?**  
* For more buttons, right-click the cogwheel icon in the bottom right corner of the screen. You can have a maximum of 2 full bars in the azerite theme, and a maximum of 4 full bars in the legacy theme.
* The stance bar will be introduced as an optional feature in an upcoming update. If you need it right away, you can always use Bartender for it along with our [our Masque skin](https://www.curseforge.com/wow/addons/masque-azerite). 

### **How can I disable the actionbars?**
* This is not a feature I intend to implement. I do realize that some of you would like this feature for it to look better with ConsolePort, or just completely replace our bars with Bartender, but dismantling our user interface to make it fit a completely different project slightly better just isn't something we're going to do.
